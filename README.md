## Usage

    <CurrencyDiamond />
  )
}

export default Example
```

## Roadmap
Below are my main ideas for the future of the library

#### **Combine similar icons into a unique component with variants**

> Habbo has multiple icons and some of then are just variants from a base icon. Maybe it's better to have one unique component that you can change the icon via a **variant prop**.

## All icons

### 1. Currency
```
CurrencyDucket
CurrencyDucketNoShadow
CurrencyDucketShadowBottom
CurrencyDucketShadowBottomPlus
CurrencyDucketShadow
CurrencyCoin
CurrencyCoinCircular
CurrencyCoinCircularShadow
CurrencyCoinShadowBottom
CurrencyCoinShadowBottomPlus
CurrencyDiamond
CurrencyDiamondIsometricShadow

```

### 2. Room

RoomCapacityQuite
RoomCapacityMany

```

### 3. Hotel
